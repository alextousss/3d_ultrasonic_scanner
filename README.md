### An Ultrasonic 3D Scanner

Detailed build log and infos [on my website](http://alextoussaint.com/2021-04-28_How-I-built-an-ultrasonic-3d-scanner.html) 

If you're looking for instructions detailed enough to build it for yourself, just add an Issue and I'll do it.
I also haven't had the time to make the code human-readable. Though, it's still understandable.
